# Cred Assignment for Flutter Developer Intern - Aryan's submission

A new Flutter project implementing a **stack framework** with expanded and collapsed states.

## Features
- **Stack-based UI framework** that supports **expanded** and **collapsed** views.
- **Interactive behavior**: Tapping on a collapsed view expands it, while any previously expanded view collapses.
- Dynamically fetches data via an **API call** to a mock URL.
- Customizable **UI design** for both expanded and collapsed states.
- Smooth **animations** and **transitions** for an enhanced user experience.
- **State management** to handle view changes efficiently.

## Assumptions
- The API provides structured data containing relevant details for stack elements.
- The stack maintains a **single expanded item** at a time to avoid clutter.
- The framework follows a **responsive design** approach to work on various screen sizes.
- Clicking outside an expanded view will not collapse it automatically.
